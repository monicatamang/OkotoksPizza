        <p> There are no short cuts when it comes to our passion. We pull out all the stops, giving you the ‘wow’ flavour, experience and consistency you not only want, but deserve. Our customers keep coming back, again, again, and again.</p>

        <p>We’re an Italian pizza shop located downtown in Okotoks, Alberta, committed to serving hardworking individuals, just like yourself. When we’re not scouring the globe (okay, the prairies) for the freshest, ripest and boldest ingredients, we’re crafting new additions to our menu for you and your colleagues to enjoy. From Margherita pizzas and Fettuccine Alfredos to Anipasto Skewers and Aperitivos, everything at Okotoks Pizza is made to provide you with an abundant amount of options to choose from – leaving you to think about what you’re going to try next!</p>
    
        <p>After watching his parents run a very successful pizza business in Calgary, Matt Cleveland learned how to make people happy, one topping at a time. Opening the doors to Okotoks Pizza in 2004, Matt has managed to evolve the fresh, traditional Italian-style pizza his family perfected back in the mid 80s to a more modern and convenient comfort food for today’s professionals on the go.</p>
        
        <p>Okotoks Pizza’s pizzas are made with only the freshest ingredients like mozzarella, roma tomatoes, made-from-scratch sauce and even features premium toppings like Sorriso Pepperoni, salami from Valbella meats and a healthy Flax crust. You feel good about ordering it. You feel good about eating it. And you feel even better knowing we're always ready to make you more.</p>
